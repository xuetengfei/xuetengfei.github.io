Welcome to the MongoDB 4.2 Manual! MongoDB is a document database designed for
ease of development and scaling. The Manual introduces key concepts in MongoDB,
presents the query language, and provides operational and administrative
considerations and procedures as well as a comprehensive reference section.

MongoDB offers both a Community and an Enterprise version of the database:

MongoDB Community is the source available and free to use edition of MongoDB.
MongoDB Enterprise is available as part of the MongoDB Enterprise Advanced
subscription and includes comprehensive support for your MongoDB deployment.
MongoDB Enterprise also adds enterprise-focused features such as LDAP and
Kerberos support, on-disk encryption, and auditing.

Document Database¶

The advantages of using documents are:

Documents (i.e. objects) correspond to native data types in many programming
languages. Embedded documents and arrays reduce need for expensive joins.
Dynamic schema supports fluent polymorphism.

MongoDB stores BSON documents, i.e. data records, in collections; the
collections in databases.

Databases In MongoDB, databases hold collections of documents.

To select a database to use, in the mongo shell, issue the use <db> statement,
as in the following example
